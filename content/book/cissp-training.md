Prepare for passing the CISSP certification exam!

<!--more-->

There are multitude of CISSP courses, books and materials out there, but this one is special: it is a collection of topics I found useful when preparing for my own certification, complemented with examples, exercises and additional information based on my own experience and knowledge.  The course is content-complete for all 8 _(ISC)<sup>2</sup> Common Body of Knowledge_ domains, although I continue improving formatting, structure and adding exercises (quizzes and exercises for the CBK domains 1-3 are there, domains 4-8 are coming).

If you are preparing for taking the CISSP exam, I am sure you will find this course useful. Get it now!
