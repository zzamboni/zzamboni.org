Learn the workflow and tools to easily self-publish books using Emacs, GitHub and Leanpub.

<!--more-->

Publishing your words has never been easier than it is today. Blogging means you can have your words read by thousands of people within minutes of writing them. Even publishing a book has become considerably easier through self publishing. There are many tools and publishers that allow you to get started for little or no money. Still, getting started can be confusing, and that is what this book is about.

In this book, I will show you the workflow and tools I use to publish [my books](https://leanpub.com/u/zzamboni). The three main tools involved are:

-   The [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) editor together with [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) for writing, editing and exporting your text;
-   [GitHub](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) to store your book files.
-   [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/) for typesetting, previewing, publishing and selling your work.

To illustrate the process and provide you with a starting point, the source repository for this book is available at <https://github.com/zzamboni/emacs-org-leanpub>. I am populating the repository live as I write this book.

Check it out, and happy writing!
