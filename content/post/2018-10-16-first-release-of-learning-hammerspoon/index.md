I am happy to announce the first release of my new book "Learning Hammerspoon", a book devoted to using [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) to make using your Mac easier, faster and more fun.

You can find more information, read a free sample, and purchase it at [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/learning-hammerspoon/).

This book is based partly on blog posts published in [my blog](https://zzamboni.org/tags/hammerspoon/), but with a lot of new material. In this first release, the following chapters are finished:

-   Getting started with Hammerspoon
-   Using Spoons in Hammerspoon
-   Just enough Lua to be productive with Hammerspoon
-   Using and extending Seal

It is not complete yet, but already includes a lot of useful information. I will be updating it frequently, and of course you get all updates for free.

I look forward to your feedback! Feel free to message me through the [_Email the author_](https://leanpub.com/learning-hammerspoon/email%5Fauthor/new) page at LeanPub.
