      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">If you use Emacs as your shell you will have all the functionality that Emacs provides <em>plus</em> you get almost all of the advantages provided by the shell itself, but built into Emacs. This article is only a quick overview of all the shells: I plan on tackling each one, in-depth, later on.</blockquote>
