<p>How to make the LG BD370 region-free (mine came set to "All regions" for Blu-Ray, but not for regular DVD). For the most complete instructions, see the <a href="http://www.videohelp.com/dvdhacks/lg-bd370/10016#30334">post by BoriMar, February 06 2010</a>. One change: I had to burn the contents of 6000.zip to a CD for it to recognize it, putting it in the USB drive didn't work, but the down/upgrade files worked fine from the USB drive. I burned the CD using the built-in capabilities of Windows Vista, just making sure to check the options for "mastered" format, and to close the session on ejecting the CD.</p>
