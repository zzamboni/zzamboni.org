<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">A
person's own name is the <strong>single most important word</strong> to him/her; it is
intimately tied to his/her identity as an individual.  How you deal with
people's names can have a profound effect on their impressions of you:
Think about the times you've felt special when someone you admired
addressed you by your name in a sincere tone; or think about the times
when you've felt belittled when someone negligently called you by the
wrong name, or worse, maliciously made fun of your name in front of you.</blockquote>

    <p>I've always been extremely bad at remembering people's names, and it's caused me my fair share of embarrassment during my life. While I lived in Switzerland, I was always amazed at how well people in general could remember names. I don't know if they train them for it, or if it's a cultural trait, but many times, for example, I was greeted by name by people I only met briefly weeks before at a party. By then, I could barely remember their faces! Lately I've been making an effort to consciously remember people's names, and it does have a positive effect, both on myself and on other people.</p>
