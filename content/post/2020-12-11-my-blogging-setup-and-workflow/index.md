My blogging has seen [multiple iterations](/about/#my-online-past) over the years, and with it, the tools I use have changed. At the moment I use a set of tools and workflows which make it very easy to keep my blog updated, and I will describe them in this post. In short, they are:

-   **Writing:** Emacs, org-mode
-   **Exporting:** ox-hugo
-   **Publishing:** Hugo and Netlify

Let's take a closer look at each of the stages.


## Writing with Emacs and org-mode {#writing-with-emacs-and-org-mode}

I have been using Emacs for almost 30 years, so its use for me is second nature. For some time I've been using [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) for writing, blogging, coding, presentations and more. I am duly impressed. I have been a fan of the idea of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) for many years, and I have tried other tools before (most notably [noweb](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/), which I used during grad school for many of my homeworks and projects), but org-mode is the first tool I have encountered which seems to make it practical. Here are some of the resources I have found useful in learning it:

-   Howard Abrams' [Introduction to Literate Programming](http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-programming-tutorial.html), which got me jumpstarted into writing code documented with org-mode.
-   Nick Anderson's [Level up your notes with Org](https://github.com/nickanderson/Level-up-your-notes-with-Org), which contains many useful tips and configuration tricks.
-   Sacha Chua's [Some tips for learning Org Mode for Emacs](http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/01/tips-learning-org-mode-emacs/), her [Emacs configuration](http://pages.sachachua.com/.emacs.d/Sacha.html) and many of her [other articles](http://sachachua.com/blog/category/emacs/).
-   Rainer KÃ¶nig's [OrgMode Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE) video series.

You can see some examples in [my "literate config files" series](/tags/literateconfig/), and all recent posts in this blog are written using org-mode (you can find the [source file](https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/zzamboni.org/-/blob/master/content-org/zzamboni.org) in GitLab).

Over time I have tweaked my Emacs configuration to make writing with org-mode more pleasant. You can see [my Emacs configuration](/post/my-doom-emacs-configuration-with-commentary/) for reference.

So, I write posts using Emacs, in org-mode markup. What's next?


## Exporting with ox-hugo {#exporting-with-ox-hugo}

When I first started writing my blog posts in org-mode, I relied on Hugo's [built-in support for it](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/), which allows you to simply create posts in `.org` files instead of `.md` and have them parse in org-mode format. Unfortunately, the support is not perfect. Hugo relies on the [go-org](https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org) library which, while quite powerful, does not support the full org-mode markup capabilities, so many elements are not rendered or processed properly.

Happily, I discovered [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/), an org-mode exporter which produces Hugo-ready Markdown files from the org-mode source, from which Hugo can produce the final HTML output. This is a much better arrangement, because each component handles only its native format: ox-hugo processes the org-mode source with the full support of org-mode and Emacs, and Hugo processes Markdown files, which are its native input format. You can use the full range of org-mode markup in your posts, and they will be correctly converted to their equivalents in Markdown. Furthermore, your source files remain output-agnostic, as you can still use all other org-mode exporters if you need to produce other formats.

Ox-hugo supports [two ways of organizing your posts](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/#screenshot-one-post-per-subtree): one post per org file, and one post per org subtree. In the first one, you write a separate org file for each post. In the second, you keep all your posts in a single org file, and specify (through org-mode properties) which subtrees should be exported as posts. The latter is the recommended way to organize posts. At first I was skeptical - who wants to keep everything in a single file? However, as I have worked more with it, I have come to realize its advantages. For one, it makes it easier to specify post metadata - for example, I have defined sections in [my org-mode source file](https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/zzamboni.org/-/blob/master/content-org/zzamboni.org) for certain frequent topics, and those are tagged accordingly in the org source. When I create posts as subtrees of those sections, they inherit the top-level tags automatically, as well as any other properties, which I use, for example, to define the header images used in the posts. Having all posts in a single file also makes it easier to share other content, such as org macro definitions, ox-hugo configuration options, etc.

Note that ox-hugo is not limited to exporting blog posts, but any content processed by Hugo. For example, my org source file also includes all the static pages in my web site - they are differentiated from blog posts simply by the Hugo [section](https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/) to which they belong, which is defined using the [HUGO_SECTION property](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/usage/#before-you-export) in my Org file.

Since the full power of org markup is available when using ox-hugo, you can do very interesting things. For example, all the posts in my [Literate Config Files](/tags/literateconfig/) category are automatically updated every time I export them with the actual, real content of the corresponding config file, which I also keep in org format. There is a lot of hidden power in org-mode and ox-hugo. My recommendation is to go through the source files for some of the websites listed in ox-hugo's [Real World Examples](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/examples/) section. I have learned a lot by reading through the source files for the [ox-hugo website](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/doc) itself.

Once you have some contents in your Org file, you can export them into Markdown files. For this, use the standard Org export dispatcher (bound to <kbd>C-c C-e</kbd> by default) and choose `[H] Export to Hugo-compatible Markdown` / `[A] All subtrees (or File) to Md file(s)` options (you may choose other options for course, but this one exports the whole file). Ox-hugo knows the default structure expected by Hugo (a top-level `content/` directory in which you have directories for each section), so there's usually not much to do other than point ox-hugo to where your top-level Hugo directory is, using the [HUGO_BASE_DIR](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/usage/#before-you-export) property.

This presumes you already have a Hugo site created. If you have never used Hugo before, I would suggest you go through the [Quick Start](http://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) guide, which shows how to set up a basic website using the [Ananke](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke) theme. This is the same theme I use for my website (with some modifications).
{{% /tip %}}

Hugo has extensive capabilities and it is beyond the scope of this article to show you how to use it, but it has [very good documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) which I would urge you to peruse to learn more about it. Feel free to peruse [my setup](https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/zzamboni.org) for ideas.

Normally I run `hugo` locally to make sure the export is OK, particularly when I'm tweaking with my sites' theme or settings. To do this, you can simply run:

```shell
hugo server
```

And browse to `http://localhost:1313`.


## Publishing with Hugo and Netlify {#publishing-with-hugo-and-netlify}

Finally! Once you are happy with the results, we have come to the point of publishing the website. I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for a long time, but nowadays I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which does a great job of hosting websites. After connecting Netlify to my website's [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/zzamboni.org), all I have to do is push the files, and Netlify takes care of running Hugo on them and publishing the results. Netlify even handles the [DNS records](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/netlify-dns/) and [SSL certificates](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/https-ssl/) for my domain!

Netlify has impressive capabilities, but for a basic website like mine, a mostly default setup works well. This is what the Build Settings look like:

{{< figure src="images/20201211-000928_zzamboni-netlify-build-settings.png" >}}

Note that I change Hugo's `publishDir` parameter from its default value of `public` to `docs`, and configure Netlify to match (note that this could also be configured in `netlify.toml`, below). This is done by specifying the parameter in Hugo's [`config.toml`](https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/zzamboni.org/-/blob/master/config.toml#L9) file:

```toml
  publishDir = "docs"
```

My repository contains a `netlify.toml` file which is used to configure some Hugo environment variables, and to specify the version of Hugo to use:

```toml
[build.environment]
  HUGO_ENV = "production"
  HUGO_VERSION = "0.83.1"
```

I also keep an [Elvish](/tags/elvish/) script for automatically updating this file to the version of Hugo currently installed on my laptop. Whenever I update Hugo locally, I test my website using `hugo server`, and then run this to instruct Netlify to upgrade to the latest version as well:

```elvish
#!/usr/local/bin/elvish
use re
hugo-ver = (put (re:find 'v([\d.]+)' (hugo version))[groups][1][text])
hugo-env = "production"
echo '[build.environment]
  HUGO_ENV = "'$hugo-env'"
  HUGO_VERSION = "'$hugo-ver'"' > netlify.toml
git add netlify.toml
git ci -m 'Updated Hugo version to '$hugo-ver
git push
```

Finally, [Hugo aliases](https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#aliases) can be handled via [Netlify redirects](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/) by following the instructions from [this blog post](https://gohugo.io/news/http2-server-push-in-hugo/) to automatically populate the redirects configuration from the Hugo source files.


## Conclusion {#conclusion}

That's it! With this setup, I can write all the contents for my website in Org-mode, and the rest is handled automatically by the tools. This makes it very easy to keep my website updated. And all these tools are available for free!

I hope you find this useful. Let me know in the comments if you have any questions.
