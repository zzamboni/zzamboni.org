<div><span>I have been blogging <a href="http://blog.zzamboni.org/tag/cfengine">about CFEngine</a> here for a while (it's my most frequent tag). As of now, I'm starting to post all CFEngine-related posts to <a href="http://blog.cf-learn.info/">http://blog.cf-learn.info/</a>, which is part of <a href="http://cf-learn.info/"></a><a href="http://cf-learn.info/">the web site for my book "Learning CFEngine 3"</a>. In this way, I intend to group all CFEngine-related content over there. I will still cross-post relevant things here, but if you want to stay fully up to date on my CFEngine writings, please subscribe over there as well.</span></div>

<div><span>I hope to see you around!</span></div>
