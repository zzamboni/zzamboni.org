I am happy to announce the new release of my new book "Literate Config", devoted to the use of [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) for writing and documenting configuration files with Emacs and org-mode.

This is the first in my planned "Geek Booklets" series, which will include short texts about specific topics. You can get at [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/lit-config), like all my other books. You can get it for free or for a price of your choosing. You can also read it [online](https://leanpub.com/lit-config/read).

I hope you enjoy it! Your feedback, as usual, is [welcome](https://leanpub.com/lit-config/email_author/new).
