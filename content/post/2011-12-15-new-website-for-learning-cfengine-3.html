<p>I'm happy to announce that the website for my book is now live at <a href="http://cf-learn.info/">http://cf-learn.info/</a>. </p>
<p></p> In this website you will find:
<ul>
<li>General information about the book. </li>
<li>A discussion forum for any type of questions, feedback or suggestions about the book. </li>
<li>Downloadable code examples from the book, plus (over time) many other new examples. </li>
<li>List of Errata, and access to the Errata system at O'Reilly </li>
<li>A blog devoted to the book and to CFEngine. </li>
</ul>
<p>The site is fairly empty at the moment (the blog, the forum and the errata page are live, I encourage you to participate, particularly if you have purchased the Early Release version of the book and want to provide any sort of feedback), but content will grow over time. </p>
<p></p> Check it out! And of course, let me know what you think.
