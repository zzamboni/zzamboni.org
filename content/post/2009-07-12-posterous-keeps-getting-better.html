<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; color: black; text-align: left;">Posterous now supports even GitHub Gists - they keep adding support for more and more different sites, both for embedding and for auto-posting. I can't wait to get my iPhone, to use it more and more effectively everywhere.</div>
