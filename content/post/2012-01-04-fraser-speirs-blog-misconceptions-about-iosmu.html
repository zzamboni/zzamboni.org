      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">
<p>Let me wrap this up by giving you a quick summary:</p>

<ol>
<li>If someone tells you that all the apps in the multitasking bar are running, using up memory or sucking power, they are wrong.</li>
<li>When you hit the home button, an app moves from Active to Background and quickly to the Suspended state where it no longer uses CPU time or drains power.</li>
<li>An app may request an additional 10 minutes of Background running to complete a big task before becoming Suspended.</li>
<li>If memory is becoming scarce, iOS will automatically move Suspended apps into the Not Running state and reclaim their memory.</li>
<li>Five classes of apps - audio, GPS, VOIP, Newsstand and accessory apps - and some built-in apps such as Mail may run indefinitely in the background until they complete their task.</li>
</ol>

    <p>Great post explaining iOS background processing and why you don't need to go around removing apps from the multitasking bar.</p>
