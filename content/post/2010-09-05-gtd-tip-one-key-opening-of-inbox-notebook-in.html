      One of the most useful applications I have discovered since I had to switch to Windows as my main OS is OneNote, a really great note-taking application which I use for pretty much every data-storing and note-taking need. I use a OneNote notebook as part of my GTD inbox. Today's very simple tip is how to assign a keystroke for opening my Inbox notebook from anywhere in the system. Here are the steps:<br><ol>
	      <li>Download and install <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a>, if you don't have it already (it's a really useful free application, well worth exploring).</li> <li>Add the following line to your default AutoHotKey.ahk file (normally in ~/Documents/AutoHotKey.ahk):<br><p>{{% gist zzamboni 566376 %}}</p>
<br>
</li> <li>Re-run AutoHotKey so it re-reads the config file.</li> </ol> Make sure you change the path of the file you want to open, and also the key to which you bind it, if don't like Win-i.<p></p>  Of course, this is useful for one-key opening of any file you want.
