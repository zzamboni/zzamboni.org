<div class="p_embed p_file_embed">
<a href=""><div class="p_icon"></div>
<div class="p_text">cf3-findpath2.cf</div>
</a>
</div>

<p>Actually, this is just to test what posterous does with a text attachment.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> so it seems it just attaches it to the page. My suggestion, which I have already emailed to the Posterous guys, is to have the option to auto-post text attachments to <a href="http://gist.github.com/">gist.github.com</a>. This would make it even easier to include code in blog posts.</p>
