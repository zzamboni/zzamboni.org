{{< leanpubbook book="learning-hammerspoon" style="float:right" >}}

I am happy to announce the third release of my book _[Learning Hammerspoon](https://leanpub.com/learning-hammerspoon)_, which includes the following changes:

-   A brand-new chapter: _Writing your own extensions and Spoons_. It is not fully finished yet, but you can find already a complete, working example of a new spoon, which you can use as a starting point for creating your own. I will continue adding more details over the next few days, but in the meantime please let me know how you like it: is the example meaningful? Are  the instructions easy to follow?
-   Two new introductory sections: _The Hyper Key_, about useful ways of defining  a common set of modifiers for your Hammerspoon keybindings; and _Keeping private information separate_, about loading separate files into your Hammerspoon configuration.
-   Multiple overall improvements in terms of wording,  figures and formatting.
-   One invisible backend change, but which bears mentioning: this book is now generated using [Markua](https://leanpub.com/markua/read) sources instead of the default [Leanpub Markdown](https://leanpub.com/help/manual) format used before. This has very little impact  on the final book as you see it, but it will make it easier in the future to handle more complex formatting as needed.

I hope you enjoy it! As usual, you can find more information, read a free sample, and purchase it at [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/learning-hammerspoon/).
