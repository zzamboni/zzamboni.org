      As annoying as Outlook is most of the time, it has a few nifty features. For example, this notification:<br><div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<img alt="Unknownname" height="48" src="/images/2011/06/20/little-useful-feature-in-outlook-you-are-not/28019286-unknownname.png" width="497">
</div>
<br> appears at the top of a compose window when appropriate. It is very useful because it appears if, while you are typing a message, another one comes into the same thread, thus reducing occurrences of "crossed" (and possibly conflicting) responses.
