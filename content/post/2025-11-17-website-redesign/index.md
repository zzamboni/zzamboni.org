Eight years ago I announced [The Big Website Reboot]({{< relref "2017-08-08-the-big-website-reboot" >}}), when I switched my website to Hugo. I'm happy to announce the first major update since then.

<!--more-->

Since then, I've been using the Hugo [Ananke](https://ananke-theme.netlify.app/) theme, which is very nice and powerful. Over time, I made adjustments not only to the configuration but also to the theme itself. Due to my lack of experience with Hugo, I failed to separate my changes from the upstream theme, which has made it difficult to upgrade to new versions. While my website was still functional, it felt a bit kludged together under the hood, and it was hard to make any changes, so I decided a major overhaul was needed.

I considered many possibilities, from upgrading Ananke itself or various other Hugo themes, including [Congo](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/congo/), [Papermod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) and [Tufte](https://hugo-tufte.netlify.app/). In the end I decided on [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/). I liked that it's extensively documented, very flexible and with many nice built-in features, including search, code highlighting, support for article series, and much more.

With this post I'm inaugurating the website with its new look. All the contents are structure remain mostly the same, though I've used the opportunity to do some cleanup and improvements as well. You'll find many new features thanks to Blowfish, such as the ability to switch dark/light mode, built-in search, "zen mode" for articles, nicer tables of contents, and more.

Please take a look! Please [let me know](/contact) if you find anything broken.
