I’d been having for some time a problem with `com.apple.dock.extra` appearing in the “Apps using significant energy” section of the battery menu. I just learned the solution (from <a href='http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1651662'>http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1651662</a>): remove BusyCal 1.6 (I upgraded to BusyCal 2, but left the old version around in case I had to go back to it). After removing it and restarting the Dock, the problem stopped.

<div>From the same thread, it seems the problem was caused by BusyCal’s “animate transitions” preference. I didn’t try that, but if you are still using BusyCal 1.6 and have this problem, it’s worth trying.</div>
