Welcome to the new zzamboni.org.

Over the years, my website has seen its fair share of transformations, change and breakage. For a few years now, it had stagnated - me with not having much time to update, and its accumulated technological cruft piling high enough to keep me from even touching it, lest I break something.

So, the time has come to do a reboot. With this post, I'm launching the new and reinvented [zzamboni.org](http://zzamboni.org/). Through previous incarnations I had always tried to preserve backwards compatibility in my URLs so people could still find my old stuff, but this has become too big a burden. I may add some things under their old location, and I may add over time some tools to make it easier to find the old stuff, but in general this won't be a concern and I will not let it stop me from adding new content.

Over the years, the underlying technologies have changed (Wordpress, Posterous, Jekyll, Octopress, Enwrite). As a tech guy, I always enjoy playing with new toys. For now I have settled on using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a great static-website generator, using its [Ananke](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/) theme. Hugo and Ananke are powerful and flexible to satisfy my needs, both current and future, as far as I can foresee them. ~~The website continues to be hosted through the fantastic [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).~~ My website was hosted on Github  Pages for many years,  but it is now served by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

So this is it. ~~For now the site is mostly empty, but new content will be appearing shortly, both new and ported from my old website.~~ I have started adding posts from my previous blogs. Thanks to Hugo's `aliases` feature, most of them should be accessible still through their old URLs.

Please take a look around, and [let me know](/contact) if you find anything broken.
