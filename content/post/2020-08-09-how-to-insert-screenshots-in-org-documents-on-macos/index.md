As I'm taking notes or writing in Org-mode, I often want to insert screenshots inline with the text. While Org supports [inserting and displaying inline images](https://orgmode.org/manual/Images.html), the assumption is that the image is already somewhere in the file system and we just want to link to it.

The [org-download](https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download) package eases the task of downloading or copying images and attaching them to a document, and it even has an `org-download-screenshot` command, but this assumes you want to initiate the screenshot from within Emacs, whereas the workflow I prefer is like this:

1.  Capture screenshot using the macOS built-in screenshot tool (<kbd>Shift​-​⌘​-​5</kbd>) and leave it in the clipboard.
2.  Paste the image into the document I'm working on.

Fortunately, `org-download` allows customizing the command used by the `org-download-screenshot` command. Together with the [pngpaste](https://github.com/jcsalterego/pngpaste) utility, this can be used to make `org-download-screenshot` store the image from the clipboard to disk, and insert it into the document. This is my configuration:

```emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-download
    :after org
    :defer nil
    :custom
    (org-download-method 'directory)
    (org-download-image-dir "images")
    (org-download-heading-lvl nil)
    (org-download-timestamp "%Y%m%d-%H%M%S_")
    (org-image-actual-width 300)
    (org-download-screenshot-method "/usr/local/bin/pngpaste %s")
    :bind
    ("C-M-y" . org-download-screenshot)
    :config
    (require 'org-download))
```

With this configuration, images are stored in a directory named `images` under the current directory, in a flat directory structure and each file is prepended with a timestamp (I would prefer not to use timestamps, but `org-download` uses a fixed filename for screenshots, which makes it difficult to insert multiple screenshots in the same document). You may want to check the `org-download` documentation and configure these settings to your liking.

Finally, I bind `org-download-screenshot` to <kbd>Ctrl​-​⌘​-​y</kbd> to keep it similar to the default <kbd>Ctrl​-​y</kbd> for pasting the clipboard and to easily perform step 2 of the workflow described above.

Now when I want to insert a screenshot in a document, I simply press <kbd>Shift​-​⌘​-​5</kbd>, capture the screenshot, switch back to Emacs, press  <kbd>Ctrl​-​⌘​-​y</kbd>, and done. It looks like this:

{{< figure src="images/20200809-171713_screenshot.png" >}}

And without inline image display, we can see that the screenshot is automatically stored inside the `images/` directory:

{{< figure src="images/20200809-172534_screenshot.png" >}}

Thanks to [this thread at Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17435995/paste-an-image-on-clipboard-to-emacs-org-mode-file-without-saving-it) for the base ideas and pointers for this configuration.

**Note:** The same technique could be used in non-macOS systems by invoking a corresponding utility that does the same. From the thread above you can get examples for both Windows and Linux.
