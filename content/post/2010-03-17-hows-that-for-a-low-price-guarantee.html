    <p>Great sense of humor (follow the link for more signs from the same store). Reminds me of the signs in a Shakey's Pizza place where we used to go when I was a kid. Two I remember:<br>"We have a deal with the bank. The bank doesn't make pizza, and we don't take checks."<br>"If you would like to use your plate for your cigarette ashes, please ask the waiter to serve your pizza in the ashtray"</p>
