I am happy to finally reveal a project I've been working on for some time: my new online course [_CISSP Training_](https://leanpub.com/c/cissp-training), now available on Leanpub.

There are multitude of CISSP courses, books and materials out there, but this one is special: it is a collection of topics I found useful when preparing for my own certification, complemented with examples, exercises and additional information based on my own experience and knowledge. I have been improving and fine tuning it for months now, and I'm happy to finally release it. The course is content-complete for all 8 _(ISC)<sup>2</sup> Common Body of Knowledge_ domains, although I continue improving formatting, structure and adding exercises (quizzes and exercises for the CBK domains 1-3 are there, domains 4-8 are coming).

To celebrate its release, you can get the course, until the end of January with a 25% discount off its regular minimum price. Just click [here](https://leanpub.com/c/cissp-training/c/initial-release) to get the discount!

If you are thinking of, or already preparing for, taking the CISSP exam, I am sure you will find this course useful. Get it now!
