**Who:**
: My name is Diego Zamboni. I am an IT architect, computer scientist, security expert, consultant, project and team leader, programmer, sysadmin, author and overall geek. I am from Mexico but live in Switzerland with my beautiful wife and our two awesome daughters.


**What:**
: I currently am the _Governance CISO_ at [Avaloq](https://avaloq.com/). Previously I worked as _Global Security Architect_ at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). I am also the author of ["Learning CFEngine"](http://cf-learn.info), ["Learning Hammerspoon"](https://leanpub.com/learning-hammerspoon) and a few [other books](https://leanpub.com/u/zzamboni).


**Where:**
: I was born in Argentina, but have moved around all my life.  When I was very young I moved to Mexico, where I lived in four different cities before moving to the U.S. to pursue my Ph.D. at [Purdue University](http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/) under the direction of [Gene Spafford](http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/). Upon finishing my studies, my wife and I decided to go to Switzerland, where I worked at the [IBM Zurich Research Lab](http://www.zurich.ibm.com/). Eight years and two kids later, we [moved to Mexico](/brt/2009/09/08/going-home/index.html) in late 2009. In 2015, we moved back to Switzerland.


**Long version:**
: If you are interested, here's my [Curriculum Vitae](/vita). For other useless trivia about me, see [here](http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/2007/03/07/blog-tagged/index.html).


## About this site {#about-this-site}

This entire site is generated by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) and served by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The source is stored in my [zzamboni/zzamboni.org](https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/zzamboni.org) GitLab repository.  I use [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/) to generate the content from [a single source file](https://github.com/zzamboni/zzamboni.org/blob/master/content-org/zzamboni.org) in [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) format, although all the older articles and pages are still stored in their original source Markdown files (I gradually convert them whenever I update them). Some of my [project](/code) pages are stored in the `gh-pages` branch of their own GitHub repositories. You can read more about my setup here: [My blogging setup with Emacs, Org mode, ox-hugo, Hugo, GitLab and Netlify]({{< relref "2020-12-11-my-blogging-setup-and-workflow" >}}).

I think it's incredible that all of this infrastructure is so easy to use and available for free.


## My online past {#my-online-past}

2008-2024 (Twitter):
: I was on Twitter fairly early (created my account in 2007, though my first tweet is from January 2008), and although I was never a super prolific user, I used it regularly for about 15 years, until its decline after its acquisition and conversion to X. My account is still there so that my username cannot be reused, but my posts are protected. You can find an archive of my tweets in this site: <https://zzamboni.org/twitter/> courtesy of [Tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback). I'm on Bluesky these days, though I don't post too much.

2009-2016:
: During this time my blog went through several iterations, hosted/powered by [Posterous](http://www.posterous.com/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), [Postach.io](https://postach.io/site) and [Enwrite](https://github.com/zzamboni/enwrite). Most blog entries from this period have been merged into [my current blog](/);

2005-2009:
: My blog titled [BrT](/brt), powered mainly by a self-hosted Wordpress installation, with some intermixed use of Posterous. What you find at the link is a static archive copy;

1997-2001:
: My hand-maintained [web page at Purdue University](http://homes.cerias.purdue.edu/~zamboni/) ([here's a mirror](/cerias/zamboni/) in case it disappears).
