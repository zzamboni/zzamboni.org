**Who:**
: My name is Diego Zamboni. I am an IT architect, computer scientist, security expert, consultant, project and team leader, programmer, sysadmin, author and overall geek. I am from Mexico but live in Switzerland with my beautiful wife and our two awesome daughters.


**What:**
: I currently am the _Governance CISO_ at [Avaloq](https://avaloq.com/). Previously I worked as _Global Security Architect_ at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). I am also the author of ["Learning CFEngine"](http://cf-learn.info), ["Learning Hammerspoon"](https://leanpub.com/learning-hammerspoon) and a few [other books](https://leanpub.com/u/zzamboni).


**Where:**
: I was born in Argentina, but have moved around all my life.  When I was very young I moved to Mexico, where I lived in four different cities before moving to the U.S. to pursue my Ph.D. at [Purdue University](http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/) under the direction of [Gene Spafford](http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/). Upon finishing my studies, my wife and I decided to go to Switzerland, where I worked at the [IBM Zurich Research Lab](http://www.zurich.ibm.com/). Eight years and two kids later, we [moved to Mexico](/brt/2009/09/08/going-home/index.html) in late 2009. In 2015, we moved back to Switzerland.


**Long version:**
: If you are interested, here's my [Curriculum Vitae](/vita). For other useless trivia about me, see [here](http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/2007/03/07/blog-tagged/index.html).


## About this site {#about-this-site}

This entire site is generated by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) and served by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The source is stored in my [zzamboni/zzamboni.org](https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/zzamboni.org) GitLab repository.  I use [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/) to generate the content from [a single source file](https://github.com/zzamboni/zzamboni.org/blob/master/content-org/zzamboni.org) in [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) format, although all the older articles and pages are still stored in their original source Markdown files (I gradually convert them whenever I update them). Some of my [project](/code) pages are stored in the `gh-pages` branch of their own GitHub repositories.

I think it's incredible that all of this infrastructure is so easy to use and available for free.
